# Brain-MRI-Image-Classification-using-kernel-SVM

This is the code file of EE3005 Capsule Project belonging Mahmut Efil and Abdulkadir Yentur.

If you want to test our project, you can open untitled.m GUI design file and simulate the 
entire system that classifies the brain MRI images using Image Proc. and Mach. Learn. methods.

In the Trainsetfinal.mat file, you can see the features belonging to Train_no and Train_yes.
