# Brain-MRI-Image-Classification-using-kernel-SVM

This is the code file of EE3005 Capsule Project belonging Mahmut Efil and Abdulkadir Yentur.

If you want to test our project, you can open untitled.m GUI design file and simulate the 
entire system that classifies the brain MRI images using Image Proc. and Mach. Learn. methods.

In the Trainsetfinal.mat file, you can see the features belonging to [1], our main dataset. In Trainsetfinal20normlu.mat, you can get the extracted features for the extra dataset [2], which is the comparison data.
